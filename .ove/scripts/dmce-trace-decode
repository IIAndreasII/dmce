NAME
        Decode DMCE trace buffer

SYNOPSIS
        ove dmce trace-decode git

OPTIONS
        git:
          choose one git of: ${repos}

PREREQUISITE
    A successful run of 'ove dmce trace-prepare'

DESCRIPTION
        This OVE plugin will decode one DMCE trace buffer and display the raw trace to the user.
        If 'fzf' (=github.com/junegunn/fzf) is installed an interactive viewer is launched.

        It's possible to force the viewer to 'fzf', 'less', 'stdout', 'stderr' or '<file>'. See EXAMPLES below!

CONFIGURATION
        # select trace viewer tool
        DMCE_TRACE_VIEWER stdout|stderr|less|fzf|<file>

EXAMPLES
        # install fzf
        $ <package manager> install fzf

        # decode the trace buffer and launch an interactive fzf viewer
        $ ove dmce trace-decode ag

        # decode the trace buffer and display the trace on stdout
        $ DMCE_TRACE_VIEWER=stdout ove dmce trace-decode ag

        # decode the trace buffer and save the trace to a file '/tmp/a.trace'
        $ DMCE_TRACE_VIEWER=/tmp/a.trace ove dmce trace-decode ag
