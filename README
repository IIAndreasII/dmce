Example of typical usage:

$ git clone https://github.com/patrikAAberg/dmce
$ git clone https://github.com/me/mygit
$ cd dmce
$ ./dmce-install
$ cd ..
$ cd mygit
$ ../dmce/dmce-launcher -n 5 
$ mytest.sh 2> outstderr.log 
$ ../dmce/dmce-summary outstderr.log

The above do the following:

1. Clones the dmce git
2. Clones the git to be played around with
3. Puts together a default .dmceconfig file and put it in your home directory. Use this file to control dmce behaviour.
4. Probes the 5 latest commits in "mygitrepo"
5. Runs a module test called "mytest.sh" using stderr to catch the output from the dmce-probe-user.c probe.
6. Summarizes the results.
